# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
@reboot /home/weather/weather/go >> /var/log/weather/weather.log 2>&1
@midnight touch /home/weather/weather/cronboot ; sudo reboot
0 3 * * * /home/weather/weather/util/move_footage.py >> /var/log/weather/move_footage.log 2>&1

# Doing this because of the white balance problem
# video goes all white in the am
#0 6,7,8,9 * * * sudo killall motion ; sudo motion

# Turn on the php web server for temp info
#@reboot /home/weather/webpage/start_php_server.sh >> /home/weather/weather/logs/temp_page.log
